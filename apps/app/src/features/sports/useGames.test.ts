 * The refresh's identity-preserving merge.
 *
 * This one is load-bearing in a way that does not show up on screen until
 * it is wrong: the cards are memoised on reference equality, so a game this
 * wrongly calls unchanged is a score that stops updating. Every test below
 * is really asking "does the card re-render when it must".
